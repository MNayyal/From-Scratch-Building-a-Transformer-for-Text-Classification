# From-Scratch-Building-a-Transformer-for-Text-Classification
I implemented a Transformer encoder purely in PyTorch (no Hugging Face!) and trained it on SST-2 (GLUE benchmark) for sentiment analysis. This project demystifies the "black box" of Transformer architectures by coding every component manually.
